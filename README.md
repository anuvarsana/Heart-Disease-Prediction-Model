# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model

**Readmission Prediction System**
This repository contains a Readmission Prediction System designed to predict hospital readmission using machine learning models. It incorporates client-server architecture, federated learning techniques, and a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for model comparison.

**Features**

**Federated Learning Simulation:**

A client-server setup where clients train local models and share updates with the server for global aggregation.
Ensures data privacy as raw data remains on the clients.

**Machine Learning Models:**

Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for prediction.
Hyperparameter tuning and overfitting detection included.

**Interactive Dashboard:**
Built with Streamlit for real-time visualization and comparison of model performance.
